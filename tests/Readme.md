# Tests for refcount

NOTE: copying native test library straight from [dynamic-interop-dll](https://github.com/jmp75/dynamic-interop-dll). This is not ideal but need expediency, and that code unlikely to change. Still Rethink whether repo structure is appropriate.

Consider UT for R and (very last cab) Matlab as well.
